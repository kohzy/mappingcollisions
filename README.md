# Mapping Motor Collisions in NYC

This was a midterm project for the Code Literacy Class in the SVA MFA Interaction Design Program.

### Demo

See the [demo](http://nycmotorcollisions.herokuapp.com/).

### Future Plans

Of course, there's always room for improvement. Here are some things I plan on doing:
* Optimizing for mobile
* Cleaning up collision information in popup
* Add animations to markers
* Enhance filtering to filter datapoints along different axes
* Add d3 chart overlay
